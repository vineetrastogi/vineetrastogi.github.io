		<h3>Exploring my Values</h3>
			<h4>December 9, 2014</h4>
			<p>
				<b>Autonomy, Loyalty, Accountability, Will-power, and Stability.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				These are all words which I think represent my values as an individual. If I could pick one word from the list above, it would be Will-power. I think this is because throughout my upbringing, education, and life in general, I've never been the best at anything. And that's not me being self-critical, its the real truth. The one thing that has got me to this point in life as been my will-power and my drive to achieve something greater. I've always put in the extra effort to get that B+ in a class where everyone got A's, or practiced Karate for however many more hours than it took my peers to succeed. I have finally, over the last year or so, gained an incredible level of confidence in myself. I think this is honestly because of the people I have tried to surround myself with, and the objective perspective I have forced myself to take when assessing my decisions.
			</p>
			<p>
				I spoke last week of the <b>Stereotype Threat</b>, and the impact that this has had on my life. I think the will-power I have used so far has been a driving force behind my ability to overcome this threat, and become more comfortable with who I am. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I recently landed a job starting next summer. It is my <b>dream job</b>, something that I have been striving for since I was a kid. This all came after four years in college trying to figure out where I was headed, and how to sell myself to employers in this crazy job market. It has been a ridiculous rollercoaster of interviews,rejections, more interviews, and receiving support from my friends and family. Where I am going with all of this is that recently, I was approached by a good friend of mine from college who is going through something similar. He asked me for advice on how to make himself more competitive. I was incredibly excited that he had reached out to me, because although I only recently got my first out-of-college job, It was flattering nonetheless.
			</p>
			<p>
				It sounds almost ridiculous to say this, but I feel like that conversation was one of the <b>turning points for me in my life</b>, at least in recent memory. The reason for this I feel like is that the conversation really made me take a step back, and truly acknowledge my accomplishments in the past year, something that I had not done before. 
			</p>
			<p>
				How does this relate to Dev Bootcamp? Well I know this is going to be a crazy 3 months, and I know I am going to feel frustrated, angry, excited, and exhausted on a daily basis. The one thing that keeps coming back to me is that <b>Will-power</b> I mentioned earlier, and how I now know that this is where life has led me, and second guessing myself provides zero benefit. If this bootcamp helps me develop technical skills that can jumpstart my career further, <b>great</b>, if not, I'll know that I put in the necessary effort and tried as hard as possible. 
			</p>
			<p>
				All I know is that I have an incredible group of friends and family supporting any decisions I make, and that is something that keeps me going, and keeps me confident.
			</p>

				Thanks for reading,
