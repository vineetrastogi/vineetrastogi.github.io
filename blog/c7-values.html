		<h3>Exploring my Values</h3>
			<h4>December 9, 2014</h4>
			<p>
				<b>Autonomy, Loyalty, Accountability, Will-power, and Stability.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				These are all words which I think represent my values as an individual. If I could pick one word from the list above, it would be Will-power. I think this is because throughout my upbringing, education, and life in general, I've never been the best at anything. And that's not me being self-critical, it's the honest truth. The one thing that has been the turning point in my life has been my will-power and my drive to achieve something greater. I've always put in the extra effort to get that B+ in a class where everyone got A's, or practiced Karate for countless more hours than my peers to succeed. I have finally, over the last year or so, gained an incredible level of confidence in myself. I think this is because of the people I have surrounded myself with, and the objective viewpoint I have forced myself to take when assessing my decisions
			</p>
			<p>
				I spoke last week of the <b>Stereotype Threat</b>, and the impact that this has had on my life. I think the will-power I have utilized thus far has been a driving force behind my ability to overcome this threat, and become more comfortable with who I am. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I recently landed a job starting next summer. It is my <b>dream job</b>, something that I have been striving for since I was a kid. This all came after four years in college trying to figure out where I was headed, and how to sell myself to employers in this crazy job market. It has been a ridiculous rollercoaster of interviews, rejections and more interviews. What has kept me going has been the unwavering support and encouragement of my friends and family. Where I am going with all of this is that recently, I was approached by a good friend of mine from college who is going through something similar. He asked me for advice on how to make himself more competitive in this job market. I was incredibly excited that he had reached out to me, because although I only recently landed my first out-of-college job, I was flattered.
			</p>
			<p>
				It sounds almost ridiculous to say this, but I feel like that one conversation was a <b>turning point in my life</b> because that one conversation really made me take a step back, and truly reflect on my accomplishments in the past year, something that I had not done before. 
			</p>
			<p>
				How does this relate to Dev Bootcamp? Well I know this is going to be a crazy 3 months, and I know I am going to feel frustrated, angry, excited, and exhausted on a daily basis. What keeps coming back to me is that Will-power I mentioned earlier, and how I now know that this is where life has led me, and second guessing myself provides zero benefit. I know this bootcamp will help me develop technical skills that will jumpstart my career further and I look forward to this new adventure. 
			</p>
			<p>
				All I know is that I have an incredible group of friends and family supporting my decisions, and that is something that keeps me going, and gives me confidence.
