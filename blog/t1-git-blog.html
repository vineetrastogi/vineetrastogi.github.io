		<h3>My First Week</h3>
			<h4>October 29, 2014</h4>
				<p>	
				It has only really been 5 days since beginning the curriculum for Dev Bootcamp's remote Phase 0 program, but I'm finding myself getting more and more excited about learning to program. The mentors at DBC and the students in my cohort have all been really supportive and eager to further each other's learning. So far, the primary things that I have worked on have been learning to use the Command Line, understanding why Version Control can be so useful, and understanding the benefits of Git and GitHub. Hopefully this blog post will give you a better understanding of what the heck these things I just mentioned are, and make sure I know what I'm talking about as well. 
				</p>
				<p>
				The Command Line Interface (CLI) is essentially a way of interacting with your system's files, programs, and interface by only typing in text based commands. Right now, most people use something called the Graphical User Interface (GUI), which is basically clicking on folder and program icons to navigate through their systems. The Command Line lets you basically do the same thing but without having to click on a bunch of different icons. At first, it was really overwhelming for me, specifically because the Command Line interface requires you to use and memorize a ton of different commands. At first, I really didnt understand why I would even need to use this interface as opposed to the GUI that everyone is used to. As I went through a few tutorials and practice sessions though, I realized that the Command Line can really do everything and more than the GUI. It allows me to download software packages, understand system errors, and more than anything, understand why directories work the way they do. For someone starting out, I highly recommend just trying not to use the GUI we're all accustomed to using, and just use the Command Line to navigate through basic folders to for example: view text documents or copy and paste a file somewhere. I'm still definitely at a basic level, but it has been fun for me to better understand how to use this tool.
				</p>
				<p>
				Version Control is basically a way to record the changes you make at any time when working on a project. You can think of it as checkpoints in a video game. If at any time you need to go back to a previous state in the game, or a project, version control will let you do just that. Version control can especially be useful when working with multiple people on a project. There may be an instance where someone makes a mistake on their portion of the project and needs to restore a previous version to restart. Version control allows them to do this pretty easily. 
				</p>
				<p>
				This is where Git and GitHub come into play. Git is a version control system that you can download on any computer. It allows you to backup and restore any version of a curent project you are working on. As a new user, it has been a really cool experience, especially when making a ton of changes to a file or project. Git uses these things called commits to save progress on a project. Basically they are equivalent to checkpoints in a video game or drafts of an essay. One specific thing that I like is that when you make a commit, you are able to create a description for what that "checkpoint" is, and why you created it. I like to be as organized as possible, so being able to create a clear set of checkpoints for my future self is pretty exciting. So what is the difference between Git and Github? Well Git is the version control system for your code *locally and GitHub is essentially a web-page which allows you to work with others *remotely. Both of these work really well with one another to help people make changes on their computers locally and then push those changes to a repository on GitHub.com. The point of even using GitHub to store your code is really so that there is a centralized location for whatever project you're working on, alone or in a group. Git seems to have become THE standard for version control and collaboration, and I'm really excited to learn more about using it!

				This was the first blog post I've ever written, and it definitely helped me to better understand the things I was supposed to learn. I hope it was useful to you in understanding these topics as well!
