### It has only really been 5 days since beginning the curriculum for Dev Bootcamp's remote Phase 0 program, but I'm finding myself getting more and more excited about learning to program. The mentors at DBC and the students in my cohort have all been really supportive and eager to further each other's learning. So far, the primary things that I have worked on have been learning to use the Command Line, understanding why Version Control can be so useful, and understanding the benefits of Git and GitHub. Hopefully this blog post will give you a better understanding of what the heck these things I just mentioned are, and make sure I know what I'm talking about as well.

### The [Command Line Interface (CLI)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) is essentially a way of interacting with your system's files, programs, and interface by only typing in text based commands. Right now, most people use something called the [Graphical User Interface (GUI)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface), which is basically clicking on folder and program icons to navigate through their systems. The Command Line lets you basically do the same thing but without having to click on a bunch of different icons. At first, it was really overwhelming for me, specifically because the Command Line interface requires you to use and memorize a ton of different commands. At first, I really didnt understand why I would even need to use this interface as opposed to the GUI that everyone is used to. As I went through a few tutorials and practice sessions though, I realized that the Command Line can really do everything and more than the GUI. It allows me to download software packages, understand system errors, and more than anything, understand why directories work the way they do. For someone starting out, I highly recommend just trying not to use the GUI we're all accustomed to using, and just use the Command Line to navigate through basic folders to for example: view text documents or copy and paste a file somewhere. I'm still definitely at a basic level, but it has been fun for me to better understand how to use this tool.
