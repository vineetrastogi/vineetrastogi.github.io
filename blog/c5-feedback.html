		<h3>Pairing and Feedback in Phase 0</h3>
			<h4>November 25, 2014</h4>
			<p>
				Pairing and Feedback have really been two of the biggest motivating factors for me in Dev Bootcamp thus far. Knowing that so many students in my cohort are looking for others to work on assignments with, and seeing the level of support for one another has been really exciting for me.
			</p>
			<h4>Pairing</h4>
			<p>
				Pairing has introduced me to many of my fellow students who are all incredibly supportive and eager to learn. Working together with these students has really helped me learn much more than if I was on my own. I think this is because when I work with others who are equally if not more motivated than myself, it boosts my confidence and boosts the statisfaction I feel when completing a challenge. Dev Bootcamp encourages a Driver/Navigator role when pairing. This allows both people throughout the duration of the session to take lead and supporting roles. This structure has been very beneficial for me, and allows me to udnerstand different perspectives and approaches to coding. Something that can be frustrating at times with Pairing is that there are times when both people have conflicting approaches and mentalities when working on a problem. To deal with this, I have tried to ensure I am as patient as possible and be as methodical as possible when outlining the steps for our work.
			</p>
			<h4>Feedback</h4>
			<p>
				The feedback mechanism provided by Dev Bootcamp has been overwhelmingly rewarding for me. All of the feedback I have received from my peers has been very actionable and kind. Because everyone in my cohort is here to learn and better ourselves, I am still blown away by how much effort each student puts into their feedback. Writing feedback initially was awkward because I wasn't sure how to phrase criticism, but after a few weeks, I've realized that as long as I can give constructive advice, people are excited to hear what others felt about their pairing session. Going forward, I'll make sure I reciprocate that effort when giving feedback, because it is really,really important, especially for this type of coursework.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a whole, I think that pairing and feedback have been really beneficial to my learning thus far. They really help to get outside perspectives when working on challenges and ensure that everyone is moving at relatively the same pace. Mastering a new discipline, I feel needs to involve a ton of collaboration, and it's exciting to see the benefits of pairing and feedback on a daily basis.
