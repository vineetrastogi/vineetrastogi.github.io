		<h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>
			<h4>December 2, 2014</h4>

			<p>
				A stereotype threat according to Claude M. Steele, is a "socially premised psychological threat that arises when one is in a situation or doing something for which a negative stereotype about one's group applies." This is a concept that I have been grappling with for a while, subconsciously for most of my academic life, and I definitely think it has come into my mind more often since I have started Dev Bootcamp. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Being of Indian ethnicity has really affected the way that I perceived myself throughout high school, college, and even now. I think many people have the idea in their minds that Indians and Asians in general will inherently excel at hard sciences, math, and technical fields. This has been both a blessing and a curse for me throughout the years. I have never truly been the best in these technical fields, and from my perspective, at times feel like I am not living up to what "I should be good at". I know that this isn't true, but it is so deeply ingrained in our society that certain people should be good at certain things, that It makes me reconsider my accomplishments and goals in life. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the major things I have learned  from college, and more recently, Dev Bootcamp, is that anyone can be good at anything. I never pictured myself getting this far in learning how to program, and although many people dont bat an eye when I tell them I'm picking up these technical skills, it has been thoroughly exciting for me. I want to believe that the majority of people dont have these stereotypes and images of what I should be doing in their minds, but it's definitely hard to avoid. Focusing on my individual goals and skills has allowed me to pick up these new technical skills regardless of my business background, and it has been fun to see it working out.
			</p>
			<p>
				I think this concept of the stereotype threat is a problem in our current society, but my subconscious approach to overcoming it has been to ignore the noise, and keep pursuing what I want to do. This mindset has definitely paid dividends for me in recent months, and the less I think about what others think of me, the better I feel about it all. Moving forward, I want to make sure I keep those societal stereotypes out of my mind when interacting with others and perceiving my own actions. Dev Bootcamp has been an awesome experience for me so far because it has allowed me to interact with so many people from different academic and cultural backgrounds who I know are working through similar struggles.
				<b>I think when it comes down to it, the "Stereotype Threat" is really only a threat if an individual perceives it that way.</b>
