		<h3>Asking Good Questions</h3>
			<h4>January 1, 2015</h4>
			<p>
				Asking good questions. It seems pretty straightforward, and easy to do. I thought as much when starting Phase 0, but realized quickly, that there is a lot of importance in how the question is crafted, the audience whom the question is directed towards, the context of the question, and many other factors. Ever since I was a kid, I've been told my teachers and professors that "there are no dumb questions". While this encourages people to ask more questions, I now feel that this can be misleading. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In my opinion, a good question needs to be <b>specific</b> and <b>contextually sound</b>. Questions, especially related to programming, need to give enough context and be focused enough for the reader to be able to answer effectively. I have made more of an effort to ask questions which help me understand a concept better, so that I won't have to ask five or ten more later on.
			</p>
			<p>
				Questions which I have struggled with getting answered have been ones that are <b>open to interpretation</b> and <b>not based on enough factual information</b>. Bad questions that I have asked have required me to do extra research, be re-structured, and don't allow for a concise answer.
			</p>
			<p>
				Overall, before Phase 0, I never really analyzed the questions I asked, and I didn't think that they needed to be carefully crafted. It has been a great experience succeeding and failing at asking good questions, and It is always exciting to receive useful advice as a result.
