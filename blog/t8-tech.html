		<h3>What is Test Driven Development?</h3>
			<h4>December 16, 2014</h4>
			<p>
				In recent weeks, as the coding challenges in Phase 0 have become more challenging, the one thing which has really helped me to work through each problem has been <b>Test Driven Development.</b> Essentially, this is a process where I would write the test code for a program before even starting on it. This makes sure that I have my goals for the program in front of me before beginning. As I go along in the program, I continue to write and run tests which incrementally shape and evaluate the program. 
			</p>
			<p>Here's a simple example of some tests written for a Ruby program.</p>
			<code><pre>
# ============== TESTS ================ #
p super_fizzbuzz([1,2,3]) == [1,2,"Fizz"]
p super_fizzbuzz([15,5,3,1]) == ["FizzBuzz","Buzz","Fizz",1]</pre></code>
			<p>
				This is a program which essentially takes in an array of integers and returns a new array with the words "Fizz", "Buzz", and "FizzBuzz" in various positions based on the conditions set in the program.
			</p>
			<p>
				The tests here though are initiated with the "p" character, and the method call is set "==" to the expected output. This will return "true" or "false" based on if that output is fulfilled by the program.
			</p>
			<p>
				When writing a program, regardless of its simplicity, it's really important to ensure that it's doing exactly what you want it to do. Test Driven Development allows you to have full control of what is going on in the program at any point in time. This is why it's crucial to create these tests before you begin the program, and as you go along. This process has been invaluable for me in recent weeks, and I hope this post was useful for you!
