		<h3>Conflict</h3>
			<h4>December 16, 2014</h4>
			<p>
				Attending the Foster School of Business at the University of Washington was one of the most rewarding and challenging time periods I can remember. The coursework and exams were difficult for sure, but it was moreso the daily interactions with diverse groups of students on a daily basis which proved to be the most challenging. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In almost every class, we would have group projects where I would be assigned to a team of 4-5 people. I really enjoy working in teams, as I feel that when I can collaborate, I can be more productive and provide better results. Despite my excitement working in groups, I quickly learned that to be successful in any workplace setting, I have to be able to work with completely different types of people.
			</p>
			<p>
				An example of conflict which provided a critical learning experience for me was when I had a group of 4 people working on a finance project. I have always viewed myself as someone who enjoys working with culturally diverse teams, and initially, I was really excited about this team. At first, we all got along pretty well, and in the scope of the class, were more than capable individually of completing our assigned portions of the project. Due to the long duration of this project, we would have weekly meetings and had a set timetable for when our deadlines needed to be met. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As the meetings went by for the first few weeks, I noticed that one team member was becoming increasingly hostile and argumentative with the rest of the team. It was really hindering our team's performance, and we were not meeting those set deadlines. At that point in time, I thought that there were probably two ways that I could approach the issue:
			</p>
			<p>
				1. I could directly speak up in a meeting to that team member and tell that that their behavior is not conducive to the well-being of the team.
			</p>
			<p>
				2. I could approach the team member outside of the team meeting and discuss what was going on.
			</p>
			<p>
				Being someone who is usually conflict-averse, I pursued the second option. I sat down with the team member and updated them on how the rest of the team, myself included, was feeling. This approach really limited the potential for any added hostility, and I was able to learn that there was a death in this person's family recently. With the knowledge of this, we were able to move forward, and be understanding of this person's situation, eventually completing the project on time.
			</p>
			<p>
				This experience seems like something that shouldn't have had a huge impact on me, but it really did. It has helped me to approach conflict with a more open mind, and come to the understanding that everyone is dealing with their own problems, and those should be considered before direct confrontation in any situation. Because this occurred my sophomore year in college, I was able to fully grasp this mindset, and it made me much more successful moving forward.
