		<h3>My Thinking Style</h3>
			<h4>November 10, 2014</h4>
			<p>
				The last three weeks have been busy to say the least. The DBC Phase 0 curriculum has been challenging for sure, requiring me to spend at least 25 hours per week working. Despite this, it has been incredibly rewarding. From working with peers on different challenges, to creating my own website from scratch, I feel like I've already learned so much. Personally, I like to work independently in most situations. As a result, I've been going through the curriculum relatively quickly, which has been a good and bad thing. On the plus side, I have been able to learn a lot in a short amount of time and feel good that I finished my work. On the other hand, working too quickly sometimes prevents me from being as detail oriented as I would like to be.
			</p>
			<p>
				I would say I definitely have a <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm" target="_blank">Concrete Sequential</a> thinking style. This essentially means that as a student, I learn best when I have a structured environment, am faced with predictable situations, and can rely on others to complete a task. The fact that all of my peers in this cohort are so willing to help one another out is really exciting for me. It removes the possibility that I might feel inferior in any way to the other students. I also believe that switching from a Fixed intelligence mindset to a Growth intelligence mindset will be crucial for me. I believe this program has already taught me to embrace challenges and fail often, while making sure I learn from those failures. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I think for me to learn as efficiently as possible, especially in this rigorous of a program, I will need to stay organized. Planning out my weekly schedule and staying consistent will allow me succeed. I think in this type of program, the most important thing I need to do though is to <b>be honest with myself</b>. I can't afford to fool myself into thinking that I understand something just for the sake of moving along and keeping up with others. I'm confident though, that having such a great group of people in this cohort will definitely help me stay on track and accomplish all that I need to.
