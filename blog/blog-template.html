					<p>10/29/2014</p>
					<p>After watching Shereef's Fireside Chat, I'm still somewhat nervous about the whole Dev Bootcamp experience. I am definitely excited to get going, and learn how to be a "world class beginner", but am mostly unsettled by the expectations for when I begin the 9 week on site program<a href="t1-git-blog.html"> ...more</a></p>

					<p>10/30/2014</p>
					<p>The last three weeks have been busy to say the least. The DBC Phase 0 curriculum has been challenging for sure, requiring me to spend at least 25 hours per week working. Despite this, it has been incredibly rewarding. From working with peers on different challenges, to creating my own website from scratch, I feel like I've already learned so much<a href="c1-chefs-kitchen.html"> ...more</a></p>

					<a href="t2-css-design.html">Learning HTML and CSS</a>
					<p>11/6/2014</p>
					<p>This week was all about learning how to use CSS and HTML to style and structure my first website. It was definitely a daunting task at first, and I had no idea where to start. After viewing various YouTube videos and reading up on best practices, I was able to become much more comfortable with creating my website from scratch<a href="t2-css-design.html"> ...more</a></p>

					<a href="t3-arrays-hashes.html">Arrays and Hashes</a>
					<p>11/10/2014</p>
					<p>This week has been all about being able to go through the basics of what makes Ruby tick. I've had basic exposure to Java through classes in college, and can say that Ruby seems like a language that is much more intuitive and syntactically basic. (I might be eating these words in a few weeks though)<a href="t3-arrays-hashes.html"> ...more</a></p>

					<a href="t4-enumerable-methods.html">How to use the "Group_by" Enumerable Method</a>
					<p>11/19/2014</p>
					<p>This last week has involved a lot more intensive work dealing with Ruby and the seemingly endless number of methods that are available. Basically a method is a tool you can use which helps reach some desired output or store some required data<a href="t4-enumerable-methods.html"> ...more</a></p>

					<p>11/19/2014</p>
					<p>Im sure you've heard, multiple times, in recent months about the concept of Net Neutrality. I wanted to use this blog post to give a brief overview of what Net Neutrality is, what it entails, and why I am supportive of it<a href="c4-tech-issues.html"> ...more</a></p>

					<a href="t5-ruby-classes.html">How and when to use Ruby classes</a>
					<p>11/25/2014</p>
					<p>For the past couple weeks, we have mostly been using methods to organize our code in ruby, and use the built-in objects that ruby provides. Most recently we have started to learn how to use Ruby Classes<a href="t5-ruby-classes.html"> ...more</a></p>

					<a href="c5-feedback.html">Pairing and Feedback in Phase 0</a>
					<p>11/25/2014</p>
					<p>Pairing and Feedback have really been two of the biggest motivating factors for me in Dev Bootcamp thus far. Knowing that so many students in my cohort are looking for others to work on assignments with, and seeing the level of support for one another has been really exciting for me<a href="c5-feedback.html"> ...more</a></p>

					<a href="t6-oop-concepts.html">Variable Scope</a>
					<p>12/2/2014</p>
					<p>One of the things that has become really important since I started working with Ruby Classes, has been understanding the usage of different types of variables.There are 5 types of variables that I've dealt with thus far<a href="t6-oop-concepts.html"> ...more</a></p>

					<a href="c6-stereotype-threat.html">Stereotype Threat</a>
					<p>12/2/2014</p>
					<p>A stereotype threat according to Claude M. Steele, is a "socially premised psychological threat that arises when one is in a situation or doing something for which a negative stereotype about one's group applies." This is a concept that I have been grappling with for a while, subconsciously for most of my academic life, and I definitely think it has come into my mind more often since I have started Dev Bootcamp<a href="c6-stereotype-threat.html"> ...more</a></p>

					<a href="t7-JavaScript.html">Loops in JavaScript vs. Ruby</a>
					<p>12/9/2014</p>
					<p>This has been my introductory week to JavaScript, and so far, I like it a lot. I think this is mostly because it is relatively similar to Ruby, at least with the way that data is presented and manipulated. One thing specifically that I wanted to focus on is looping in Ruby vs. looping in JavaScript<a href="t7-JavaScript.html"> ...more</a></p>

					<p>Autonomy, Loyalty, Accountability, Will-power, and Stability. These are all words which I think represent my values as an individual. If I could pick one word from the list above, it would be Will-power<a href="c7-values.html"> ...more</a></p>

					<a href="t8-tech.html">What is Test Driven Development?</a>
					<p>12/16/2014</p>
					<p>In recent weeks, as the coding challenges in Phase 0 have become more challenging, the one thing which has really helped me to work through each problem has been Test Driven Development. Essentially, this is a process where I would write the test code for a program before even starting on it<a href="t8-tech.html"> ...more</a></p>

					<a href="c8-conflict.html">Conflict</a>
					<p>12/16/2014</p>
					<p>Attending the Foster School of Business at the University of Washington was one of the most rewarding and challenging time periods I can remember. The coursework and exams were difficult for sure, but it was moreso the daily interactions with diverse groups of students on a daily basis which proved to be the most challenging.<a href="c8-conflict.html"> ...more</a></p>
