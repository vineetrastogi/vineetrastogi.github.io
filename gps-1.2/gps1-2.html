            <h2>Why is it important to Dev Bootcamp?</h2>
            <p>
                Peer Pairing is really important in DBC because it creates a collaborative, and immersive experience which teaches us the culture of the Ruby community. It allows for the pair to hear one another's immediate feedback and verbal methodologies for solving a problem.

            <h2>Driver vs. Navigator</h2>
            <p>
                The Driver is the "captain" of the ship who operates the moving parts while the navigator is the guide who ensures that everything is being done well and according to specifications.
